Dedicated to Rey. I will not remember you but I will always remember having to write this.

To operate the application:

Upon performing most functions within the application, the displayArea on the right of the screen will output a message 
detailing the results.

There are two ways to start using the application.
You can choose to load the saved file from the bottom left button or you can choose to create a new list. 

If you choose load the saved file, it will automatically create a list from that data and then you can choose what
to do from there.
If you choose to create a new list, the first step you will need to do is enter a name for the list and press the 
adjacent button at the top of the screen.

Directly below the title area, you can choose to display every item in the list or only complete or incomplete items. 
Pressing these buttons will populate the displayArea with the corresponding data.
Adjacent to these buttons is the sort button which sorts the data in the lists by their due date.

The second section in the application is about adding new items to the list. There are fields corresponding to due date 
and description and a checkbox to demarcate if the item has been completed. Once the desired information has been written,
pressing the add item button will add this item to the list.

The third section is about updating pre-existing items. There is a field for the description of the item that is desired 
to be updated. Pressing the search button will populate the fields and checkbox below that with that item's data if 
it exists within the list. To alter the item, simply change what is written in these boxes/ checkbox and press edit item.
If the user instead wants to delete an item, the remove item button will remove the item with the corresponding description 
from the list if it exists.

The final section contains larger scale buttons with the aforementioned load from file button as well as a save to file 
button that stores the list in a text file that the program can read the next time the application is used. The last 
button written in read to highlight the danger of the button will clear every item from the list when it is pressed.
